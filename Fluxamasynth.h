    Fluxamasynth.cpp
    A library to facilitate playing music on the Modern Device Fluxamasynth board.
    More info is at www.moderndevice.com; refer to "Using the Fluxamasynth Arduino 
    Library" in the DocsWiki.
    -------------------------------------
    This version was derived from the library provided by Modern Devices
    . The NewSoftSerial library is used to communicate with the synth
    . The Constructor has been changed to take the rx and tx pin numbers
      (and instantiate the NewSoftSerial library); The default constructtor
      writes to pin 4, and disables receive.
    . A Polymorphic function, fluxWrite(...) has been added to write thru
      to the synth; it may be used alone, or in combination with existing
      library functions (use of fluxWrite must leave the synth capable of
      accepting library commands after, however).
    -------------------------------------
    This software is in the public domain.
